      <p class="text-white mb-8">American healthcare is a mess. Built up piecemeal over decades, different players have added processes to provide and extract value from the system. The result has been an institution that is complex, expensive, and fraught with misaligned incentives. One day, I hope to see a system that prioritizes people's health, and players that profit from health rather than sickness.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-2">üìà We need new business models.</h3>
      <p class="text-white mb-8">We need new business models. We need to move away from the traditional fee-for-service model and towards a model where we pay for outcomes. Eventually, with this approach, both payers and providers will be incentivized to get more people participating in their health and will profit from that. Hopefully one day, paying for healthcare will be like paying for a haircut.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-white mb-2">‚≠ê Startups are the future.</h3>
      <p class="text-white mb-8">Simplicity is king for lowering costs. Legislators and policymakers continuously believe the solution to lowering cost is more rules, more regulations, and more complexity. While they have the best intentions, they cannot foresee how players will find ways to game the system. To avoid the complexity of the current system, we need new players to make their own rules and build from first principles. Incumbents are rarely the best-positioned players to create new business models.</p>
